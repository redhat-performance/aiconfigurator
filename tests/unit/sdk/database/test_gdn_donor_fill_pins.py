"""Query-level pins for the GDN cross-backend donor fill.

The op_kernel_source_manifest regen (f869f616d) made three gdn_perf
kernel_sources cross-backend inheritable (`causal_conv1d_fn`,
`chunk_gated_delta_rule`, `fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_packed_decode`).
Audit result (2026-08-04): donors only EXTEND grids — zero pre-existing
leaf values changed on the audited combos (first-wins keeps own rows) —
but the extensions are real: +48 leaf points on b200_sxm/sglang/0.5.14 and
+43 on h200_sxm/vllm/0.24.0, all context-phase boundary coordinates for
Qwen3.5/Nemotron-H-family shards.

The pinned values below are the CURRENT post-regen truth and INCLUDE
cross-backend donor fill as of f869f616d. Each test pins one donor-only
coordinate (absent before the regen) and one own-row coordinate (proving
first-wins still shields the active backend's measurements). Every query
is an exact grid hit, so perf_interp returns the raw leaf — no
interpolation noise. If any of these move (manifest change, new data,
loader change), that shift must be a conscious act.
